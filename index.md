I am Ettore Speziale, an Italian programmer with special interest in compilers, parallel runtimes and hardware.
This site contains material about academic research, teaching, and some personal information.

I did a Ph.D. in the [Formal Languages and Compilers Group][www/flac] of Politecnico di Milano.
My Ph.D is about compilers and runtime technologies for parallel programming models.
During my studies I did an internship at [Barcelona Supercomputing Center][www/bsc], where I developed a small OpenCL runtime prototype for supercomputing clusters.

Now I am working at [ARM][www/arm], in the Media Processing Division.
My main duty is developing/maintaining the ARM OpenCL runtime for the Mali T6xx GPGPUs family, in particular the interaction between the runtime itself and the OpenCL compiler.

For Students
------------

In the past I was teaching assistant for some courses.
All material I published on course official sites have been mirrored here.
Look at the [Teaching](teaching/index.html) section.

For Programmers
---------------

During high schools I had to take some classes about _technical_ drawing.
I am not good at drawing.
My professor known that, and I always got very low marks.

Some programmers do not know how to program.
They do not indent the code, do not use any coding convention, do not test the code, think that all data structures have the same performance, and that there is no need to think about the code because the hardware can execute without problems a very bad algorithm.

_"Why are they not considered harmful by most of people working in computer science?"_
