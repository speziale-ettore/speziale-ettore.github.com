title: Software Compilers
---
{% include JB/setup %}

The goal of this course is to provide an high-level introduction to compiler internal structure.
Professor [Stefano Crespi Reghizzi](mailto:crespi@elet.polimi.it) is the main teacher.
It teach students theoretical concepts about compilers, such as a language and parsing theories.
Professor [Giovanni Agosta](mailto:agosta@elet.polim.it) is in charge of introducing the structure of a compiler, as a set of passes that are executed in a pipeline fashion.
My duty is to show students the internals of a simple compiler.

The exam is composed by two parts: a class test about theory of compilation and an homework.

Academic Year 2011-2012
-----------------------
Teaching material for this year can be downloaded from the [website][www/agosta] of Professor Agosta: look at the _Software Compilers_ page.
You can download the sources of ACSE -- the compiler used during the course -- and all slides used by teachers.
Here you can find slides used my me:

* [Introducing Software Compilers Laboratory] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/introducing-software-compilers-laboratory.pdf)
* [Lexical Analysis] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/lexical-analysis.pdf)
* [Semantic Analysis] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/semantic-analysis.pdf)
* [Introducing ACSE] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/introducing-acse.pdf)
* [Control in ACSE] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/control-in-acse.pdf)
* [Linear ACSE] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/linear-acse.pdf)
* [Assembler] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/assembler.pdf)

To get a pass grade, you have to complete one of the following homeworks:

* [Control Flow and i386] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/control-flow-and-i386.pdf)
* [Exceptions and Indirect Addressing] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/exceptions-and-indirect-addressing.pdf)
* [Switch Statement and LLVM] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/switch-statement-and-llvm.pdf)
* [Vector Operations] (/teaching/download/swc/2011-2012/vector-operations.pdf)

The results of the homework must be sent to the teachers before final evaluation in the form of a patch.
Moreover, after the in class test you are required to comment on your homework.
