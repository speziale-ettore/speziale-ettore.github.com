During my Ph.D. at Politecnico di Milano I was teaching assistant of several courses, mainly in the area of formal languages, programming languages, and compilers.
I tried to provide as much as possible material to students, with special interest on code examples.
Indeed I think that the only way for learning computer science is putting hands into the code.

Courses are grouped per institution.
Not all pages are in English.
Some are in Italian, because the corresponding course was given in Italian.
The same rule does not hold for teaching material.
For instance [Principi dei Linguaggi di Programmazione](/teaching/principi-dei-linguaggi-di-programmazione.html) was given in Italian, but all teaching material is written in English.

As reported in the [homepage](/index.html), you can do whatever you want with this teaching material.
The only constraint is about the _Evilness_ of Java.
